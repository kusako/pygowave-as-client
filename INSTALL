------------------------------------
 
The API requires Adobe Flex 3.4 or greater, the Flex project has been created
using Flash Builder 4.0 beta 2.
 
First, make sure you have as3corelib.swc and Stomp_06.swc in your build path
(the Flex Project expects them in lib/).
 
Use Import existing project in Flash Builder 4 or use the build process of
your SDK.
